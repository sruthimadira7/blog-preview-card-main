## My process

My very first thought is that I focussed on getting the layout right. As this is a simple blog preview card, Once I am done with the layout thing.

I broke the inner contents into three different sections:

- The first section only contains the image.
- The second section contains the most important information.
- The last section consisted of avatar image and name.

### Built with

- Self-host fonts
- Layout and Accessibility
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Naming

### What I learned

I thought that I can build this simple component within no time.. but it took me a while like almost 2hrs.
The key take away from here is that it is difficult to build a pixel perfect design.
It comes down to those minor details like how you make things reponsive with respect to different screen widths.

### Continued development

I want to do more and more projects and see how far I can reach in building projects I Love.
I want to improve on layout and resposive thing.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Variables](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/css-variables-for-react-devs/) - This helped me in giving a better name for my custom properties. I really liked this naming and will use it going forward.
- [Box-Shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/box-shadow) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand box-shadow. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
